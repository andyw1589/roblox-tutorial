        <h1>Chapter 1: Printing</h1>
        <p>
            This chapter will introduce the basics in printing things to the output console.<br>

            To start, create a new game in Roblox Studio and open the command bar.<br>
            <img src="command line open.PNG" width="800" height="auto"><br>

            The most basic type of program you can make is to "print" something to the screen - in other words, make text appear.<br>
            In the command line, type in <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> and hit enter:<br>
            <img src="hello world.PNG" width="300" height="auto"><br>
            Ta-da! "Hello World" was just shown in the output console. Notice that we put our sentence in double quotes.<br>

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Print out "Goodbye, World!"</h3>

            Sentences aren't the only thing that can be printed. We can print numbers, too:<br>

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Print out your favourite number.</h3>
            You can even print out math expressions:<br>
            <img src="printing math.PNG" width="300" height="auto"><br>
            You can see here that <code>+</code> is addition, <code>-</code> is subtraction, <code>*</code> is multiplication, and <code>/</code> is division.
            You can use brackets to specify the order of operations:<br>
            <img src="printing brackets.PNG" width="300" height="auto"><br>
            You can see that when printing <code>(5 + 2) * 3</code>, 5 + 2 is evaluated first, which is 7. Then it is multiplied, giving us 3.<br>
            On the other hand, when printing <code>5 + 2 * 3></code>, 2 * 3 is evaluated first because the order wasn't specified. So the result
            is 5 + 6 = 11. Without brackets, multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction.

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: What is the difference between (4 + 3) * (4 / 5) and 4 + 3 * 4 / 5? Print out the result.</h3>

            This concludes the basics in printing.<br>

                <h2>Exercises:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Print out the sum of 5, 8, 3, and 25.</a></li>
                    <li>Print out your name.</li>
                    <li>Print out your favourite song lyrics.</li>
                    <li>"Concatenate" means to attach two sentences together. This is done using two periods: <code>print("Hello".."World")</code> will
                    print out "HelloWorld". Use concatenation to print out the words "Raining", "Tacos", and "Yummy", all attached together.</li>
                    <li>Use concatenation to print out "Hello World", <strong>with</strong> the space.</li>
                </ol>
