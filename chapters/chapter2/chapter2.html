            <h1>Numbers</h1>
            <p>Numbers can be divided into two types: integers and floats. Integers are basically the "whole numbers" that you've learned
            in elementary school: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 56, 79, and so on. A float is essentially a decimal number: 5.0, 6.79, 4.20, and so on.
            Floats themselves are much more complicated than that, so watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdFG2GcNuA" target="_blank">this video</a>
            if you want to learn more about them.</p>

            <h1>Characters and Strings</h1>
            <p> A character is a single letter, like 'A', 'B', 'c', 'd', '$', '?', and anything else you can type. A string is a bunch of characters strung together,
            hence the name "string." In other words, strings are entire words or sentences, or any other collection of characters. Some examples
            of strings are: "Hello, World!", "jhfsdjkf9832", and "Bruh."</p>

            <h1>Booleans</h1>
            <p> Booleans might sound weird if you've never heard them before, but they're basically just <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> (note: they are NOT the literal strings "true" and "false").
                For example, the statement "1 + 1 = 2" is a <em>true</em> statement, but "1 + 2 = 6" is <em>false</em>. These are Booleans (fun fact: they are named after

            <h1>Variables</h1>
            <p>We just went through a bunch of data types, but how would we actually represent and store them in Luau? The answer is variables.<br>
            <br>
            You might have heard about variables in your elementary school math classes: if 4x + 3 = 13, then find the value of x. Variables in programming are somewhat
            similar; they have a name, and they represent a certain value.<br>
            <br>
            The basic format for declaring a variable in the command line is: <code>name = value</code>. Let's try out an example in the ROBLOX Studio command line:</p>

            <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="images/x_is_5.PNG" width="300" height="auto">

            <p>Here, we've created a variable named <code>x</code>, and assigned it the value of 5 (an integer!).</p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                <b>Quick Exercise: Try storing other types of data in x, like 6.7, "Hello", and <i>true</i></b>
            </div>

            <p>Note that there are a few constraints on what you can name a variable; you can only use letters, underscores, and numbers, but it must not
            start with a number.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                <b>Quick Exercise: Which of the following are valid variable names? Click on them to verify.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li class="pb-1"><button class="btn btn-light right-answer">Hi</button></li>
                    <li class="pb-1"><button class="btn btn-light right-answer">y</button></li>
                    <li class="pb-1"><button class="btn btn-light right-answer">_he11o</button></li>
                    <li class="pb-1"><button class="btn btn-light wrong-answer">45num</button></li>
                    <li class="pb-1"><button class="btn btn-light wrong-answer">my var</button></li>
                    <li class="pb-1"><button class="btn btn-light right-answer">my_var</button></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Once you have a variable, you can now reference it using its name:</p>

            <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="images/print_x.PNG" width="200" height="auto">

            <p>Since we stored the integer 5 in our variable named <code>x</code>, doing <code>print(x)</code> basically does the same thing as <code>print(5)</code>.</p>
        
            <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                <b>Quick Exercise: Create a variable, store a string inside it, and then print the variable.</b>
            </div>

            <p>We can also do math using variables:</p>

            <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="images/var_math.PNG" width="300" height="auto">

            <p>In the code above, we defined <code>y</code> to be 7, and <code>x</code> to be 2. So doing <code>y + x</code> is the same thing as doing <code>7 + 2</code>, which is 9.</p>

                <li>Let <code>x = 5</code>, and <code>y = 9</code>. Let <code>z = x + y</code>. Consider the statement "z is equal to 15." Is this true or false?</li>

                <li>Try the following in the command line: let <code>x = 5</code>, and <code>y = x</code>. Then change <code>x</code> to be 8. What happens if you print out <code>y</code>?</li>
                <li>We can use the <code>typeof</code> function to get the type of a variable. Let <code>myVar = "5"</code>.
                    Then type <code>print(typeof(myVar))</code> in the command line. What gets printed out? Use this to check your answers to the previous problems.</li>
