        <h1>Chapter 2: Data and Variables</h1>
        <p>
            This chapter will introduce the basic types of data there are, and how to represent them in Lua and Luau.<br>

            The basic types of data are numbers, characters, strings, and booleans.<br>

            <h2>Numbers</h2>
            Numbers can be divided into two types: integers and floats. Integers are basically the "whole numbers" that you've learned
            in elementary school: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 56, 79, and so on. A float is essentially a decimal number: 5.0, 6.79, 4.20, and so on.
            Floats themselves are much more complicated than that, so watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdFG2GcNuA" target="_blank">this video</a>
            if you want to learn more about them.
            
            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Print out each of the numbers listed above.</h3>

            <h2>Characters and Strings</h2>
            A character is a single letter, like 'A', 'B', 'c', 'd', '$', '?', and anything else you can type. A string is a bunch of characters strung together,
            hence the name "string." In other words, strings are entire words or sentences, or any other collection of characters. Some examples
            of strings are: "Hello, World!", "jhfsdjkf9832", and "Bruh."

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Classify the following values: 1, '1', "One"</h3>

            <h2>Booleans</h2>
