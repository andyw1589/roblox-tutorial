        <h1>Chapter 2: Data and Variables</h1>
        <p>
            This chapter will introduce the basic types of data there are, and how to represent them in Lua and Luau.<br>

            The basic types of data are numbers, characters, strings, and Booleans.<br>

            <h2>Numbers</h2>
            Numbers can be divided into two types: integers and floats. Integers are basically the "whole numbers" that you've learned
            in elementary school: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 56, 79, and so on. A float is essentially a decimal number: 5.0, 6.79, 4.20, and so on.
            Floats themselves are much more complicated than that, so watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdFG2GcNuA" target="_blank">this video</a>
            if you want to learn more about them.
            
            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Print out each of the numbers listed above.</h3>

            <h2>Characters and Strings</h2>
            A character is a single letter, like 'A', 'B', 'c', 'd', '$', '?', and anything else you can type. A string is a bunch of characters strung together,
            hence the name "string." In other words, strings are entire words or sentences, or any other collection of characters. Some examples
            of strings are: "Hello, World!", "jhfsdjkf9832", and "Bruh."

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Classify the following values: 1, '1', "One"</h3>

            <h2>Booleans</h2>
            Booleans might sound weird if you've never heard them before, but they're basically just <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> (note: they are NOT the literal strings "true" and "false").
            For example, the statement "1 + 1 = 2" is a <em>true</em> statement, but "1 + 2 = 6" is <em>false</em>. These are Booleans (fun fact: they are named after
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" target="_blank">George Boole.</a>).

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Classify the following values statements as either true or false:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Earth is in space.</li>
                <li>2 + 2 = 5</li>
                <li>Luau is used to program ROBLOX games.</li>
                <li>The Olympics are held every four years.</li>
                <li>The moon is not real.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            We just went through a bunch of data types, but how would we actually represent and store them in Luau? The answer is variables.<br>
            <br>
            You might have heard about variables in your elementary school math classes: If 4x + 3 = 13, then find the value of x. Variables in programming are somewhat
            similar; they have a name, and they represent a certain value.<br>
            <br>
            The basic format for declaring a variable in Luau is: <code>name = value</code>. Let's try out some examples in the ROBLOX Studio command line:<br>
            <img src="x_is_5.PNG" width="300" height="auto"><br>
            Here, we've created a variable named "x", and assigned it the value of 5 (an integer!).

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Try storing other types of data in x, like 6.7, "Hello", and <em>true</em>.</h3>

            Note that there are a few constraints on what you can name a variable; you can only use letters, underscores, and numbers, but it must not
            start with a number.

            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Which of the following are valid variable names?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hi</li>
                <li>y</li>
                <li>_he11o</li>
                <li>45num</li>
                <li>my var</li>
                <li>my_var</li>
            </ul>

            The cool thing about variables is that we can now reference them just by using their name:<br>
            <img src="print_x.PNG" width="200" height="auto"><br>
            Since we previously stored the integer 5 in our variable named x, doing <code>print(x)</code> basically does <code>print(5)</code>.
            
            <h3 class="quickexercise">Quick Exercise: Create a variable, store a string inside it, and then print the variable.</h3>

            We can also do math using variables:<br>
            <img src="var_math.PNG" width="300" height="auto"><br>
            In the code above, we defined y to be 7, and x to be 2. So doing y + x was the same thing as doing 7 + 2, which is 9.<br>

                <h2>Exercises:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Classify the following values: true, 1, "false", "one", 5 + 7, (5 + 7) / 89, '5'</li>
                    <li>Define the variables x to be "Hello", and y to be "Bye". Store their concatenation in a variable named z. What is the type of z?</li>
                    <li>Let x = 5, and let y = 9. Let z = x + y. Consider the statement "z is equal to 15." Is this true or false?</li>
                    <li>You can use concatenation with variables: if we let s = "Bob", then <code>print("Hello "..s)</code> prints out "Hello Bob". Store your name in a variable, and use concatenation
                    to print out your own greeting.</li> 
                    <li>Let b = "true". Consider the following statement: "The variable b is a boolean." What Boolean value does it have?</li>
                    <li>Try the following in the command line: define x to be 5, and y to be x. Then change x to be 8. What happens if you print out y? Can you explain why?</li>
