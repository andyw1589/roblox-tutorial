            <h5 class="text-center border-bottom border-3 px-5 pb-2">I've been pretty dissatisfied with a lot of beginner articles about how to make a ROBLOX game. Most of these start off with
                a small project, glossing over the basic fundamentals of programming, or at least not explaining them enough. They'll throw advanced things
                like event handling and functions at you, as well as syntax that can be daunting to beginners. In my opinion, without a solid foundation in basic
                programming concepts to stand on, you'll get nowhere. This site serves to teach those fundamentals from the very basics, eventually leading to more advanced
                concepts.
